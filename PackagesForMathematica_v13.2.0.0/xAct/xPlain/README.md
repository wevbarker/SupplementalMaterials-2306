## About

xPlain is an (unofficial) part of the [xAct bundle](http://www.xact.es/). It is designed for the formatting of unambiguous, lasting derivations in the Wolfram language. It is suitable only for those who use the Wolfram language programatically (i.e. running notebooks how they should be run, purely via plaintext input).

## Installation

#### Requirements 

xPlain has been tested in the following environment(s):
- Linux x86 (64-bit), specifically Manjaro and Arch
- Mathematica v 13.1.0.0
- xAct v 1.2.0

#### Install 

1. Make sure you have [installed xAct](http://www.xact.es/download.html).
2. Place the `./xAct/xPlain` directory relative to your xAct install. A global install might have ended up at: 
	```bash
	/usr/share/Mathematica/Applications/xAct
	```
