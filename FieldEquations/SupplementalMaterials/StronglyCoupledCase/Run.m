Comment@"Now we have moved over into the second-order formalism, and we have also set up some quite powerful tools for manipulating expressions in this formalism. The next step is to begin investigating the relevant theories. We will begin with the general theory in which no Lagrange multiplier has been applied, this will give us strong-coupling behaviour.";
