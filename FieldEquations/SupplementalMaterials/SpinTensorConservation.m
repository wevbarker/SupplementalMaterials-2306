Comment@"The satisfaction of the conservation law therefore rests on the
multiplier terms. Not immediately clear to me why this is true, but according
to the old code here I was satisfied at one point that these expressions vanish
on the shell imposed by the multipliers. It would be worth returning to this to
verify.";

Comment@"Once again, by substituting for the source currents on the field equation shell, we have shown these terms to cancel, but the calculation itself is omitted for brevity.";
